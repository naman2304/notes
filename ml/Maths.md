## Importance of Mathematics in Machine Learning

Understanding the mathematics behind machine learning (ML) is crucial for:
* **Deeper understanding:** Grasping *how* and *why* ML algorithms work.
* **Customization and development:** Moving beyond off-the-shelf algorithms to build and customize models.
* **Algorithm selection:** Better judging when to apply specific techniques.
* **Debugging:** More effectively identifying and resolving issues in ML algorithms.
* **Innovation:** Potentially inventing new ML algorithms.

## Specialization Overview

This specialization consists of three courses:

### Course 1: Linear Algebra

* **Duration:** Four weeks.
* **Concepts covered:** Vectors, matrices, linear transformations, systems of equations, determinants.
* **Perspective:** Matrices are not just arrays of numbers; they can be viewed in deeper ways, like how a neural network uses matrix operations to transform, rotate, and warp data through multiple layers to arrive at a prediction.
* **Relevance to ML:** Many fundamental learning algorithms, including neural networks, are built upon matrix operations. A deeper intuition helps understand the "magic" of these algorithms.

### Course 2: Calculus

* **Concepts covered:** Focus on maximizing and minimizing functions.
* **Relevance to ML:**
    * The vast majority of learning algorithms are designed by creating a **cost function** and then **minimizing** it.
    * Understanding derivatives helps in tuning optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, Adam) to perform better when they are not working as expected.
    * Demystifies optimizers that might initially seem obscure.

### Course 3: Probability and Statistics

* **Concepts covered:** Probability distributions, hypothesis testing, p-values.
* **Relevance to ML:**
    * Many ML models output probabilities.
    * **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** A key concept where the goal is to find the scenario (model) that most likely generated the observed evidence (data). This involves maximizing the probability that the model generated the given data.
    * Gaining a deeper understanding of probability and statistics helps achieve a better mastery of ML algorithms.

## Practical Application

* Learners will not only study the math but also see it implemented in **Python code** through practical labs.
* Basic Python knowledge is assumed, with resources provided for those needing to get up to speed.
* The specialization progresses from a high school math level to core concepts relevant for ML and data science.

Understood. I will revert to using `$` for inline equations and `$$` for display-block equations, without any HTML tags for centering, as GitHub's rendering environment for MathJax/LaTeX often overrides or ignores them.

Here are the notes:

## Week 1: Systems of Linear Equations

This week introduces the concept of a **system of linear equations**, its representations, and the significance of **singular** and **non-singular systems** in linear algebra. Linear algebra is a fundamental and widespread mathematical field in machine learning.

### Applications of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning

Linear algebra is crucial for many ML applications, with **linear regression** being a prime example.

### Course Approach

This course prioritizes building a strong **mathematical foundation**. While machine learning examples will provide context, the primary goal is understanding the math. It's okay if you don't grasp all ML details; the focus is on the underlying mathematics.

### Linear Regression: A Machine Learning Example

* **Supervised Learning:** Linear regression is a supervised machine learning approach where you have collected data (inputs and outputs) and aim to discover relationships between them.
* **Example: Wind Turbine Power Prediction**
    * **Single Feature (Wind Speed):** If only wind speed ($x$) is used to predict power output ($y$), the relationship can be modeled by a line.
        $$y = mx + b$$  
        In machine learning, this is often written as:
        $$y = wx + b$$  
        where $w$ is the "**weight**" and $b$ is the "**bias**". The goal is to find the best $w$ and $b$ values to fit the data.
    * **Multiple Features (Wind Speed, Temperature, etc.):** When more features (e.g., wind speed $x_1$, temperature $x_2$) are considered, the equation expands:  
        $$y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b$$  
        Graphically, with two features, this forms a plane in 3D space.
        For $n$ features, the model becomes:  
        $$y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \ldots + w_n x_n + b$$  
        The aim is to find the right values for the weights ($w_i$) and bias ($b$) to make accurate predictions, assuming a linear relationship.
* **Dataset Representation:**
    * For a single data record, the equation is:  
        $$y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \ldots + w_n x_n + b$$  
        Here, $x_i$ and $y$ values are known, and the goal is to find $w_i$ and $b$.
    * For a dataset with $m$ records, each record provides an equation:  
        $$y^{(1)} = w_1 x_1^{(1)} + w_2 x_2^{(1)} + \ldots + w_n x_n^{(1)} + b$$  
        $$y^{(2)} = w_1 x_1^{(2)} + w_2 x_2^{(2)} + \ldots + w_n x_n^{(2)} + b$$  
        $$\vdots$$  
        $$y^{(m)} = w_1 x_1^{(m)} + w_2 x_2^{(m)} + \ldots + w_n x_n^{(m)} + b$$  
        The superscripts $(j)$ denote the $j^{th}$ example in the dataset and are *not* exponents.
* **System of Linear Equations:** Ideally, the values of weights and bias terms would solve all these equations simultaneously, or at least get as close as possible. This collection of equations forms a **system of linear equations**, a core topic for this week.

### From Long Form to Vector/Matrix Notation

The long-form equation can be represented more compactly using vectors and matrices:
* A **vector of weights** $w$ (containing $w_1, \ldots, w_n$).
* A **matrix of features** $X$ (where each row is a feature set $x^{(m)}$).
* A **vector of targets** $y$.
* The model then becomes (conceptually, details of transpose depend on vector definitions):  
    $$y = w X + b$$  
    (Note: The precise vector/matrix multiplication requires careful handling of transposes, but the core idea is compact representation).

### Systems of Linear Equations in Machine Learning

* Linear regression fundamentally represents the system as a **system of linear equations**.
* If a perfect set of $w$ and $b$ values exists that perfectly predicts $y$ given $x$, then this system could be solved **analytically** (with basic algebra), provided there are at least as many unique data records as there are unknowns ($w$'s and $b$).
* In practice, linear regression solves the system **empirically** (iteratively and approximately) by finding the best-fit linear solution.

### Week 1 Concepts and Challenge Questions

This week will cover:
* Systems of linear equations.
* Representation of systems using vectors and matrices.
* Manipulation of these systems to compute determinants and other characteristics.

**Challenge Scenario:** Suppose you have scores $a$ (Linear Algebra), $c$ (Calculus), and $p$ (Probability and Statistics).
1.  **Equation 1:** Linear Algebra score + Calculus score - Probability and Statistics score = 6
    $$a + c - p = 6$$
2.  **Equation 2:** Linear Algebra score - Calculus score + 2 * Probability and Statistics score = 4
    $$a - c + 2p = 4$$
3.  **Equation 3:** 4 * Linear Algebra score - 2 * Calculus score + Probability and Statistics score = 10
    $$4a - 2c + p = 10$$

**Questions to Consider:**

1.  **Represent as a System of Linear Equations:** (Already done above).
2.  **ML Equivalents:**
    * **Weights ($w$):** Your scores $a, c, p$ (these are the consistent unknowns we're trying to find).
    * **Features ($x$):** The coefficients next to the scores in each equation (e.g., for the first equation: $1, 1, -1$).
    * **Target ($y$):** The numbers on the right side of the equal sign ($6, 4, 10$).
3.  **Singular or Non-Singular?** Do these equations contradict each other, or is there redundant information? Can this system be solved?
4.  **Matrix and Vector Representation:** Can you represent this system as a matrix and a vector?
5.  **Determinant:** Can you calculate the determinant of that matrix?

Answering these questions indicates readiness for the week's quiz and labs. If not, the week's materials will guide you step-by-step through solving such systems and understanding properties like singularity and the determinant.
