*   **Key Problems:**
    *   Should an AI application be built?
    *   How to evaluate AI applications and AI outputs (using AI to evaluate AI)?
    *   Causes, detection, and mitigation of **hallucinations**.
    *   Best practices for **prompt engineering**.
    *   How **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works and its strategies. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are built upon retrieval technology that has powered search and recommender systems since long before the term RAG was coined.
    *   What an **agent** is, how to build and evaluate one.
    *   When and when not to **finetune** a model.
    *   Data requirements and quality validation.
    *   Methods to make models faster, cheaper, and more secure.
    *   Establishing a **feedback loop** for continuous application improvement.
*   **Comparison of the book with "Designing Machine Learning Systems" (DMLS):**
    *   **DMLS:** Focuses on applications with **traditional ML models**, involving tabular data annotations, feature engineering, and model training.
    *   **AI Engineering (AIE):** Focuses on applications with **foundation models**, involving prompt engineering, context construction, and parameter-efficient finetuning.
    *   **Relationship:** AIE can be a companion to DMLS. Both are self-contained and modular. A real-world system often combines both traditional ML and foundation models.
* **Lindy's Law:** Assuming a technology's future life expectancy is proportional to its current age (if it's been around, it will likely continue).
