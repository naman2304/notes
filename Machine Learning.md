# Machine Learning: An Introduction

**Machine Learning (ML)** is the science of enabling computers to **learn without explicit programming**. You use it daily in many ways, like:

* **Web search** (ranking pages)
* **Image tagging** (recognizing friends)
* **Movie recommendations**
* **Voice assistants** (voice-to-text, Siri, Google Assistant)
* **Spam detection**

## Broader Applications

Beyond consumer apps, ML is transforming industries:

* **Climate change** (optimizing wind turbines)
* **Healthcare** (aiding diagnoses)
* **Manufacturing** (inspecting defects with computer vision)

# Machine Learning: Skills and Impact

This course teaches **state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** used by top tech companies, along with **practical tips for effective implementation and performance**. You'll gain hands-on experience.

## Why ML is Essential Today

ML, a subfield of AI, addresses complex tasks difficult to program explicitly (e.g., web search, speech recognition, self-driving cars). Machines **learn to perform these tasks independently**.

ML is impacting nearly every industry, from healthcare and agriculture to manufacturing and e-commerce. Its applications are widespread, from **Google Brain and Baidu's AI initiatives** to **Landing.AI's factory automation**.

## The Future and Value of ML

While **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is a distant goal, **learning algorithms are key** to advancing AI. ML is projected to add **$13 trillion USD to the global economy by 2030**, with vast untapped potential outside the software industry. This immense demand makes learning ML skills highly valuable now.

The next video will delve into the formal definition of ML and introduce its main types of problems and algorithms.

# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1950s). Samuel's checkers program, by playing tens of thousands of games against itself, learned to be a better player than Samuel, demonstrating that **more learning opportunities lead to better performance**.

## Main Types of Machine Learning

This course covers various ML algorithms, primarily focusing on:

1.  **Supervised Learning:** Most widely used in real-world applications and has seen rapid advancements. Covered in the first two courses of this specialization.
2.  **Unsupervised Learning:** Covered in the third course, along with recommender systems and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems are the most frequently used learning algorithms today.

## Practical Application

This specialization emphasizes **practical advice for applying ML algorithms effectively**. Beyond just understanding algorithms, you'll learn:

* How to apply ML tools effectively.
* Best practices for developing valuable ML systems, preventing common pitfalls.
* How skilled ML engineers design and build robust systems.

# Supervised Learning: Input to Output Mappings

**Supervised learning** constitutes nearly all economic value generated by machine learning today. It involves algorithms that learn **input (x) to output (y) mappings** by being given **examples with the correct answers (labels)**. The algorithm then predicts the output for new, unseen inputs.

## Examples of Supervised Learning

* **Spam Filter:** Input (email) -> Output (spam/not spam)
* **Speech Recognition:** Input (audio clip) -> Output (text transcript)
* **Machine Translation:** Input (English text) -> Output (Spanish text)
* **Online Advertising:** Input (ad/user info) -> Output (click/no click) - A highly lucrative application.
* **Self-driving Cars:** Input (image, sensor data) -> Output (position of other cars)
* **Visual Inspection (Manufacturing):** Input (product picture) -> Output (defect/no defect)

In all these cases, models are **trained with input-output (x, y) pairs** and then predict 'y' for new 'x' inputs.

## Housing Price Prediction: A Regression Example

Consider predicting house prices based on size. You provide the algorithm with a dataset of **house sizes (x)** and their **corresponding correct prices (y)**.

* When given a new house size (e.g., 750 sq ft), the algorithm, by fitting a line or curve to the data, can predict its price (e.g., $150,000 or $200,000).
* The course will teach how to systematically choose the best fit (line, curve, etc.).

This is **supervised learning** because the algorithm is given the "right answers" (prices) for training.

This specific type of supervised learning, where the output 'y' is a **continuous number** (like price), is called **regression**. The next video will cover **classification**, another major type of supervised learning, where the output is discrete.

# Supervised Learning: Classification

**Supervised learning algorithms predict input (X) to output (Y) mappings.** While **regression** predicts a **continuous number** (e.g., housing prices), **classification**, the second major type, predicts a **category** from a small, finite set of possibilities.

## Classification in Action: Breast Cancer Detection

In breast cancer detection, an ML system takes patient medical records (inputs) to classify a tumor as either **malignant (cancerous, denoted as 1)** or **benign (non-cancerous, denoted as 0)**.

* **Key Difference from Regression:** Classification predicts from a **limited set of outputs (e.g., 0 or 1)**, not an infinite range of numbers.
* **Data Representation:** Tumor size (X) can be plotted against a binary output (0 or 1). Even with multiple tumor types (e.g., Type 1, Type 2 cancer), the outputs remain discrete categories.
* **Output Classes/Categories:** These terms are interchangeable. Categories can be non-numeric (e.g., "cat" or "dog") or numeric (e.g., 0, 1, 2) but are always discrete, not continuous values like 0.5 or 1.7.

## Multiple Inputs in Classification

Classification problems can utilize **multiple input values** (features). For instance, in breast cancer detection, besides tumor size, **patient age** can be another input.

* With multiple inputs, a learning algorithm might find a **boundary line** to separate different categories (e.g., benign from malignant tumors) on a plot.
* Real-world applications often use **many more inputs** (e.g., tumor clump thickness, cell uniformity) to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Summary of Supervised Learning

Supervised learning maps input `X` to output `Y`, learning from "right answers." Its two main types are:

* **Regression:** Predicts a **number** from an infinite range (e.g., house prices).
* **Classification:** Predicts a **category** from a small, finite set of outputs (e.g., malignant/benign).

Next, we'll explore **unsupervised learning**, another major type of machine learning.

# Unsupervised Learning: Finding Structure in Data

**Unsupervised learning** is the second most widely used form of machine learning. Unlike supervised learning, it deals with **unlabeled data** (no 'y' outputs) and aims to **find inherent structure, patterns, or interesting insights** within the data itself. It's called "unsupervised" because the algorithm isn't given "right answers" to learn from; it figures out patterns on its own.

## Clustering: Grouping Unlabeled Data

A prominent type of unsupervised learning is **clustering**, which automatically groups unlabeled data into distinct clusters.

### Examples of Clustering:

* **Google News:** Groups hundreds of thousands of daily news articles into related stories (clusters) by identifying common words or themes. The algorithm autonomously determines these groupings without human pre-programming for specific topics.
* **Genetic/DNA Data Analysis:** Clusters individuals based on their genetic activity (e.g., from DNA microarrays) to identify different genetic "types" of people. This helps researchers uncover natural groupings in biological data.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Companies use clustering to automatically group customers into different market segments based on their data. This helps in efficiently serving diverse customer needs (e.g., DeepLearning.AI identified segments like "skill-seekers," "career developers," and "AI trend followers" within its community).

Clustering algorithms take unlabeled data and automatically group it into clusters. Besides clustering, there are other types of unsupervised learning. The next video will explore these further.

# Unsupervised Learning: Beyond Clustering

**Unsupervised learning** uses data with **inputs (x) only** (no output labels 'y') to find hidden **structure or patterns**. We previously discussed **clustering**, which groups similar data points.

## Other Unsupervised Learning Types:

This specialization also covers:

1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual events, crucial for **fraud detection** in finance and other applications.
2.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Compresses large datasets into smaller ones with minimal information loss. (More details on these later in the specialization).

## Quiz: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Examples

Here's a quick check on understanding:

* **Spam filtering:** **Supervised learning** (if labeled spam/non-spam data is available).
* **Grouping news stories:** **Unsupervised learning** (clustering, like Google News).
* **Market segmentation:** **Unsupervised learning** (discovering segments automatically from customer data).
* **Diagnosing diabetes:** **Supervised learning** (like breast cancer classification, with labeled diabetes/not diabetes data).

While clustering was the primary focus, we'll cover anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction in depth later.

# Supervised Learning: Linear Regression Fundamentals

This video introduces **Linear Regression**, a widely used supervised learning algorithm that **fits a straight line to data** for prediction. Concepts learned here are broadly applicable to other ML models.

## Predicting House Prices (Regression Example)

Using a dataset of house sizes and prices, we'll demonstrate linear regression:

* **Goal:** Predict a house's price (output, **y**) based on its size (input, **x**).
* **Method:** The model draws a straight line through existing data points. For a new house size, you follow this line to estimate the price.
* **Supervised Learning:** This is "supervised" because the model learns from a **training set** containing **"right answers"** (known house sizes with their corresponding prices).
* **Regression:** This is a **regression problem** because the output (price) is a **continuous numerical value**.
    * **Contrast with Classification:** Classification predicts discrete **categories** (e.g., cat/dog, specific diseases) from a finite set of outputs.

## Data Representation & Notation

Data can be visualized as a plot or a table. Standard ML notation for datasets:

* **Training Set:** The dataset used to train the model.
* **Input Variable (x):** Also called a **feature**. E.g., house size.
* **Output Variable (y):** Also called the **target variable**. E.g., house price.
* **m:** Total number of training examples (rows in the dataset).
* **$(x, y)$:** Denotes a single training example (input-output pair).
* **$x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$:** Refers to the $i^{th}$ training example (the $i^{th}$ row in the data table). Note: $(i)$ is an index, not an exponent.

The next video will detail how this training set is used to train a learning algorithm.

# Supervised Learning Process: Linear Regression

Supervised learning algorithms take a **training set** (inputs 'x' and their correct 'y' outputs) and produce a **function (f)**, also called a **model**. This model, 'f', takes a new input 'x' and outputs a **prediction, ŷ, y-hat**. ŷ is predicted value, while y is the actual true value.

## Linear Regression Model

For now, we'll use a straight line function: $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$. Also, written as $f(x) = wx + b$.

* **w** and **b** are numerical parameters that define the line's slope and intercept.
* This function (or model) makes predictions (ŷ) based on input x.
* **Linear regression with one variable** (or **univariate linear regression**) uses a single input feature. Later, we'll cover models with multiple features.

## The Role of the Model

The learning algorithm **fits this linear function to the training data**, aiming to create the "best-fit" straight line. This line then provides predictions for new inputs.

## Important Note

**Regression models** predict **continuous numbers** (e.g., house prices). This contrasts with **classification models**, which predict discrete categories (e.g., cat/dog).

Next, we'll learn about the crucial concept of a **cost function**, essential for training virtually all ML models.

To implement linear regression, the first key step is defining a **cost function**. This function tells us how well our model performs, allowing us to improve it.

## Model Parameters and Function

Recall our linear function: $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$.
* **w** and **b** are the **parameters** (or coefficients/weights) of the model. We adjust these during training.
* Different values of **w** and **b** result in different lines on the graph (different functions $f(x)$).
    * **w** controls the **slope**.
    * **b** controls the **y-intercept**.
* Our goal is to choose **w** and **b** so that the line $f(x)$ **"fits the data well,"** meaning it passes close to the training examples.

## Measuring Model Fit: The Cost Function

For each training example $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, our model predicts $ŷ^{(i)} = f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$. We want these predictions ($ŷ^{(i)}$) to be close to the actual target values ($y^{(i)}$).

To measure "how well" the line fits, we use a **cost function**, denoted as $J(w, b)$. For linear regression, we typically use the **squared error cost function**:

$J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (ŷ^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$

$J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$

Let's break down this formula:
1.  **Error for each example:** $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})$ is the difference between the model's prediction and the true target.
2.  **Squared Error:** We square this difference, $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$, to ensure errors don't cancel out and to penalize larger errors more heavily.
3.  **Summation:** $\sum_{i=1}^{m}$ sums these squared errors across all $m$ training examples.
4.  **Average:** Dividing by $m$ (and conventionally by $2m$) calculates the **average squared error**, preventing the cost from simply growing with the number of training examples. The division by 2 is for mathematical convenience in later calculations.

The **cost function $J(w, b)$** quantifies how "badly" our line fits the training data. A **smaller $J(w, b)$ value** means a **better-fitting line**.

The next video will build intuition about what different values of $J(w, b)$ signify.

# Cost Function: Intuition and Minimization

This video builds intuition for the **cost function**, $J(w, b)$, which measures how well our linear regression model $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$ fits the training data. Our goal is to **minimize $J(w, b)$** to find the optimal parameters $w$ and $b$.

## Simplified Model: $f_w(x) = wx$ (Setting $b=0$)

To visualize, we simplify the model to $f_w(x) = wx$, making $J$ a function of only one parameter, $w$.

* **Model $f_w(x)$:** A straight line passing through the origin (since $b=0$). $w$ is its slope.
* **Cost Function $J(w)$:**
    $J(w) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (w \cdot x^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$
    This measures the average squared difference between the model's prediction and the true target values for a given $w$.

## Visualizing Model Fit and Cost

Let's use a simple training set: $(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)$.

1.  **If $w=1$:**
    * **Model $f_1(x) = 1x$:** This line perfectly fits the data points.
    * **Cost $J(1)$:** For each point, $f_1(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}$ is 0. So, $J(1) = 0$. This is the minimum possible cost, indicating a perfect fit.

2.  **If $w=0.5$:**
    * **Model $f_{0.5}(x) = 0.5x$:** This line has a shallower slope and doesn't perfectly align with the data.
    * **Cost $J(0.5)$:** There are errors (vertical distances) between the line and the data points. For example, at $x=1$, $f(1)=0.5$ while $y=1$, so the error is $0.5-1=-0.5$. Squaring and summing these errors gives a higher cost, $J(0.5) \approx 0.58$.

3.  **If $w=0$:**
    * **Model $f_0(x) = 0x$:** This is a horizontal line on the x-axis.
    * **Cost $J(0)$:** The errors are even larger, resulting in a higher cost, $J(0) \approx 2.33$.

By plotting $J(w)$ for various $w$ values, we trace out a **bowl-shaped curve**. The **lowest point on this curve corresponds to the $w$ value that minimizes the cost function**, giving the best fit to the data. In our simplified example, $w=1$ clearly minimizes $J(w)$ to 0.

## Conclusion for Linear Regression

The goal of linear regression is to **find the parameters ($w$ and $b$, or just $w$ in the simplified case) that minimize the cost function $J**. A smaller $J value signifies a better-fitting line.

The next video will visualize the cost function for the full linear regression model with both parameters, $w$ and $b$, using 3D plots.

# Visualizing the Cost Function $J(w, b)$

This video provides further visualizations of the **cost function $J(w,b)$** for linear regression, where $w$ and $b$ are the model parameters. The goal is to **minimize $J(w,b)$** to find the best-fitting line.

## 3D Surface Plot of $J(w, b)$

* Unlike the simplified $J(w)$ (U-shaped curve), $J(w,b)$ is a **3D, bowl-shaped surface**.
* The **w** and **b** axes form the base, and the **height** represents the value of $J(w,b)$ for specific $w$ and $b$ choices.
* Every point on this surface corresponds to a unique pair of $(w,b)$ values and their associated cost.
* For example, a model $f(x) = 0.06x + 50$ would have a specific $(w,b)$ point on this surface, representing its cost. This particular model might consistently underestimate housing prices, leading to a high cost.

## Contour Plots of $J(w,b)$

A **contour plot** offers a 2D representation of the 3D cost function surface.

* Imagine taking **horizontal slices** of the 3D bowl. Each slice, representing points with the **same cost value**, forms an **oval (ellipse)** on the 2D contour plot.
* The axes of the contour plot are **w** (horizontal) and **b** (vertical).
* **Concentric ovals** show different cost levels; the **smallest, innermost oval** represents the **minimum cost** at the bottom of the bowl.
* Points on the same oval have the same cost $J(w,b)$, even if their $w$ and $b$ values differ. These points correspond to different lines (functions $f(x)$) that might fit the data equally (and sometimes poorly).

The goal is to find the **(w, b) pair at the very center of the innermost oval** in the contour plot, as this represents the minimum cost $J(w,b)$, and thus the best-fitting line.

The next video will use these visualizations to show how different choices of $w$ and $b$ affect the straight line fit on the data.

# Gradient Descent Algorithm

This video introduces **Gradient Descent**, a widely used algorithm to **systematically find parameter values (w, b) that minimize the cost function J(w,b)**. It's applicable not only to linear regression but also to complex models like neural networks.

## How Gradient Descent Works

1.  **Objective:** Minimize the cost function $J(w, b)$ (or $J(w_1, \dots, w_n, b)$ for more parameters).
2.  **Initialization:** Start with initial guesses for $w$ and $b$ (e.g., both set to 0).
3.  **Iterative Adjustment:** Gradient descent **repeatedly adjusts parameters** (w and b) in small steps to **reduce the cost $J$**, hoping to converge near a minimum. (**Note**: there can be more than 1 values w, b for which there is global minima)

## Visualizing Gradient Descent (Hilly Landscape Analogy)

Imagine the cost function $J(w,b)$ as a hilly landscape, where height represents cost and valleys are minima.

* **Starting Point:** You begin at some point on this "hill" (corresponding to initial $w, b$ values).
* **Steepest Descent:** At each step, you **look around 360 degrees** and take a small step in the **direction that goes downhill fastest** (the "steepest descent"). This is the most efficient way to reduce cost locally.
* **Iteration:** You repeat this process, taking successive steps, until you reach the bottom of a valley, which is a **local minimum**.

## Local Minima

* For some complex cost functions (unlike the always bowl-shaped linear regression cost), there can be **multiple local minima**.
* **Starting point matters:** Where you start on the "hill" can determine which local minimum you converge to. If you start on a different part of the hill, you might end up in a different valley.

The next video will delve into the mathematical formulas required to implement gradient descent.

# Implementing Gradient Descent

This video details the implementation of the **Gradient Descent algorithm**, which iteratively updates model parameters (w and b) to minimize the cost function $J(w, b)$.

## Gradient Descent Algorithm Steps

For each parameter, the update rule is:

**$w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b)$**  
**$b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial b} J(w, b)$**

Where:

* **`=` (Assignment Operator):** In this context, it means updating the variable on the left with the value computed on the right (e.g., `new_w = old_w - ...`).
* **$\alpha$ (Alpha):** The **learning rate**, a small positive number (e.g., 0.01). It controls the **size of the step** taken downhill.
    * **Large $\alpha$:** Aggressive, large steps.
    * **Small $\alpha$:** Small, "baby" steps.
* **$\frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial b} J(w, b)$ (Derivative Terms):** These terms tell us the **direction and steepness** of the "hill" at the current $(w,b)$ point. They indicate the direction of steepest descent. (No prior calculus knowledge is needed for this course).

## Simultaneous Update of Parameters

A crucial detail for correct gradient descent implementation is to **simultaneously update all parameters (w and b)**.

* **Correct (Simultaneous) Update:**
    1.  Calculate the new values for `w` and `b` based on their *current* (old) values and derivatives.
        * `temp_w = w - alpha * (d/dw J(w,b))`
        * `temp_b = b - alpha * (d/db J(w,b))`
    2.  Then, update `w = temp_w` and `b = temp_b`.
    This ensures both updates use the same, consistent starting point (the `w` and `b` values *before* any update in that step).

* **Incorrect (Non-Simultaneous) Update:**
    * If you update `w` first (e.g., `w = w - alpha * ...`) and then use this *new* `w` when calculating the update for `b`, it's incorrect. While it might sometimes "work," it's a different algorithm with different properties.

Gradient descent is repeated until convergence, meaning the parameters `w` and `b` no longer change significantly with each step, indicating a local minimum has been reached.

The next video will delve into the details of the derivative terms, providing the necessary intuition to implement gradient descent.

# Gradient Descent: Intuition Behind Derivatives and Learning Rate

This video provides intuition for the **gradient descent algorithm**:  

$w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b)$ (for the full model).  
$b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial b} J(w, b)$ (for the full model).  

## Understanding the Derivative Term

The derivative (or partial derivative) term in the update rule represents the **slope of the cost function $J$ at the current parameter value $w$**.

Let's assume partial model only (assume b = 0)  
$w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w)$ (simplified to one parameter, $w$).  

* **Positive Slope:** If you are on the right side of the minimum, the tangent line to $J(w)$ has a positive slope.
    * Example: If derivative is +2.
    * Update: $w = w - \alpha \times (+2)$. Since $\alpha$ is positive, $w$ will **decrease**.
    * Effect: Moving $w$ to the **left**, closer to the minimum of $J(w)$.

* **Negative Slope:** If you are on the left side of the minimum, the tangent line to $J(w)$ has a negative slope.
    * Example: If derivative is -2.
    * Update: $w = w - \alpha \times (-2) = w + \alpha \times 2$. $w$ will **increase**.
    * Effect: Moving $w$ to the **right**, closer to the minimum of $J(w)$.

In both cases, the derivative term (scaled by $\alpha$) guides $w$ in the direction that **reduces the cost $J(w)$**, moving towards the minimum.

# Gradient Descent: The Importance of Learning Rate ($\alpha$)

The **learning rate ($\alpha$)** critically affects **gradient descent's efficiency and convergence**. The update rule is $W = W - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial W} J(W)$.

## Impact of $\alpha$ on Convergence:

* **$\alpha$ too small:** Leads to **slow convergence**. Steps are tiny, requiring many iterations to reach the minimum.
* **$\alpha$ too large:** Can cause **overshooting, oscillations, or divergence**, potentially failing to reach the minimum. The cost might even increase.

## Gradient Descent at a Local Minimum:

* If $W$ is at a **local minimum**, the **derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial W} J(W)$ is zero**.
* The update becomes $W = W - \alpha \times 0 = W$, meaning the parameter **remains unchanged**, correctly staying at the minimum.

## Automatic Step Adjustment:

* As gradient descent approaches a local minimum, the **slope (derivative) naturally decreases**, becoming flatter.
* This automatically leads to **smaller update steps**, even with a fixed $\alpha$, allowing the algorithm to gradually settle into the minimum.

Gradient descent is a versatile optimization algorithm for any cost function $J$. Next, we'll combine it with the **mean squared error cost function** to build the **linear regression algorithm**.

# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This video combines the linear regression model, the squared error cost function, and the gradient descent algorithm to enable training.

## Derivatives for Gradient Descent

$J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$

To implement gradient descent for linear regression, we need the partial derivatives of the cost function $J(w,b)$ with respect to $w$ and $b$:

* **Derivative w.r.t. $w$:**
    $\frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)}$
* **Derivative w.r.t. $b$:**
    $\frac{\partial}{\partial b} J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})$

**(Optional Calculus Derivation):** These formulas are derived using calculus. The $1/2$ in the cost function ($1/2m$) was deliberately chosen so that the '2' from the power rule of differentiation cancels out, simplifying these derivative expressions.

## The Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression

The algorithm iteratively updates $w$ and $b$ simultaneously until convergence:

$w = w - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)} \right)$  
$b = b - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \right)$

where $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$ is the linear regression model.

## Convexity and Global Minimum

A key property of the squared error cost function used with linear regression is that it is **convex**.

* **Convex Function:** Informally, a "bowl-shaped" function. It has **only one global minimum** and no other local minima.
* **Impact on Gradient Descent:** For convex cost functions, as long as the learning rate $\alpha$ is appropriately chosen, gradient descent is **guaranteed to converge to the global minimum**, regardless of the starting point of $w$ and $b$.

## Batch Gradient Descent:

* Specific implementation we learned till now is called **batch gradient descent**.
* **"Batch"** refers to the fact that **every step of the algorithm uses *all* training examples** (the entire "batch" of data) to compute the derivatives for the parameter updates.
* Other versions of gradient descent exist that use subsets of data.

# Multiple Linear Regression: Beyond a Single Feature

This week, we enhance linear regression to handle **multiple input features**, significantly boosting its power.

## Model with Multiple Features

Previously, we used a single feature ($x_1$, house size) to predict price ($y$). Now, let's incorporate multiple features:
* $x_1$: Size
* $x_2$: Number of bedrooms
* $x_3$: Number of floors
* $x_4$: Age of home

We denote these features as $x_j$ (where $j=1$ to $n$, and $n$ is the total number of features; here $n=4$). A training example $x^{(i)}$ becomes a **vector** (list) of these $n$ features for the $i$-th example: $x^{(i)} = [x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}, x_3^{(i)}, x_4^{(i)}]$.

The linear regression model with multiple features becomes:
$f_{w,b}(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4 + b$

* **Interpreting Parameters ($w_j$):** Each $w_j$ indicates how much the output ($y$) changes for a unit increase in feature $x_j$, holding other features constant. For example, if $w_1=0.1$ and $x_1$ is in sq ft, it means $0.1 \times \$1000 = \$100$ increase per sq ft. $b$ is the base price.

## Vectorized Notation for Multiple Linear Regression

For $n$ features, the model is $f_{w,b}(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b$.

To simplify this, we use **vector notation**:
* **Parameters Vector ($\vec{w}$):** $\vec{w} = [w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n]$
* **Features Vector ($\vec{x}$):** $\vec{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$

Using the **dot product**, the model can be written compactly as:
$f_{\vec{w},b}(\vec{x}) = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b$

Where $\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n$.

This type of model is called **Multiple Linear Regression**. This is NOT multivariate regression (that's something else)

# Vectorization: Speeding Up Machine Learning Code

**Vectorization** is a crucial technique for implementing learning algorithms. It makes code both **shorter** and **significantly more efficient**, leveraging modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs.

## What is Vectorization?

It means performing operations on entire arrays (vectors) at once, rather than iterating through individual elements using loops.

### Example: Computing the Model's Prediction ($f_{w,b}(\vec{x}) = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b$)

Let's assume we have $n=3$ features, so $\vec{w} = [w_1, w_2, w_3]$ and $\vec{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$. In Python with NumPy, array indexing starts from 0 (e.g., `w[0]`, `x[0]`).

1.  **Non-Vectorized (Manual calculation):**
    ```python
    f = w[0]*x[0] + w[1]*x[1] + w[2]*x[2] + b
    ```
    * **Issue:** Inefficient for large $n$, cumbersome to write.

2.  **Non-Vectorized (Using a for loop):**
    ```python
    f = 0
    for j in range(n): # j goes from 0 to n-1
        f += w[j]*x[j]
    f += b
    ```
    * **Issue:** Better for writing, but still computationally inefficient due to the explicit loop.

3.  **Vectorized (Using NumPy):**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    f = np.dot(w, x) + b
    ```
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Shorter Code:** One line for the dot product.
        * **Faster Execution:** NumPy's `dot` function is highly optimized. Behind the scenes, it utilizes **parallel hardware** (CPU's SIMD instructions, GPU cores) to perform computations on multiple data elements simultaneously. This dramatically speeds up operations, especially for large vectors.

# How Vectorization Works: The Magic Behind the Speed

Vectorization dramatically speeds up machine learning code by leveraging your computer's hardware for parallel processing.

## Non-Vectorized (Sequential) Execution:

* A traditional `for` loop executes operations **one after another**.
* For example, in a loop calculating `w[j]*x[j]`, each multiplication and addition is done sequentially for `j=0`, then `j=1`, and so on. This is slow for large datasets.

## Vectorized (Parallel) Execution:

* **NumPy functions** (like `np.dot` for dot products) are **vectorized implementations**.
* **Behind the scenes, your computer's hardware (CPU with SIMD instructions, or GPU cores) can:**
    1.  Perform **multiple element-wise operations (e.g., multiplications)** **simultaneously in parallel**.
    2.  Use **specialized hardware** to efficiently perform subsequent operations (e.g., summing up results) much faster than sequential additions.

## Why Vectorization Matters for ML:

* **Speed:** Vectorized code runs **much faster** than non-vectorized code, especially for large datasets and complex models. This can reduce computation time from hours to minutes.
* **Scalability:** It's essential for **scaling learning algorithms** to the massive datasets prevalent in modern machine learning.
* **Conciseness:** It makes code **shorter and easier to read**.

## Example: Updating Multiple Parameters in Gradient Descent

For $n$ features, updating $w_j = w_j - \alpha \cdot d_j$ (where $d_j$ is the derivative for $w_j$):

* **Non-Vectorized (for loop):**
    ```python
    for j in range(n):
        w[j] = w[j] - 0.1 * d[j]
    ```
    * Executes each update sequentially.

* **Vectorized (NumPy):**
    ```python
    w = w - 0.1 * d # w and d are NumPy arrays
    ```
    * The computer performs all $n$ subtractions and multiplications **in parallel** in a single step using specialized hardware.

The accompanying optional lab introduces NumPy and demonstrates how vectorized code runs significantly faster than explicit loops. This foundational understanding of vectorization is key to efficient machine learning implementation.

# Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression with Vectorization

This video consolidates **gradient descent**, **multiple linear regression**, and **vectorization** for efficient model training.

## Multiple Linear Regression Model (Vectorized)

* **Parameters:** Instead of individual $w_1, \dots, w_n$ and $b$, we represent them as a **vector $\vec{w}$ (of length $n$) and a scalar $b$**.
* **Model Equation:**
    $f_{\vec{w},b}(\vec{x}) = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b$
    where $\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x}$ is the dot product.
* **Cost Function:** The cost function $J$ is now $J(\vec{w}, b)$, taking a vector and a scalar as input.

## Gradient Descent Update Rules (Vectorized)

The parameters $\vec{w}$ and $b$ are updated repeatedly and **simultaneously**:

* **For each $w_j$ (where $j=1 \dots n$):**
    $w_j = w_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{\vec{w},b}(\vec{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}$
* **For $b$:**
    $b = b - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_{\vec{w},b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})$

These derivatives are derived from the squared error cost function and extend naturally from the single-feature case.

## The Normal Equation (Alternative Method - Optional)

* The **Normal Equation** is an **alternative, non-iterative method** to find optimal $w$ and $b$ for **linear regression *only***. It uses advanced linear algebra to solve directly.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Not generalizable** to most other ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks).
    * **Slow for large number of features (n)**.
* While not recommended for manual implementation in most cases, some mature ML libraries might use it internally for linear regression. Gradient descent is generally preferred for its broader applicability and scalability.

# Feature Scaling: Accelerating Gradient Descent

**Feature scaling** is a technique that can significantly **speed up gradient descent**. It addresses the issue where features have vastly different ranges of values.

## The Problem: Feature Scale and Parameter Relationship

Consider predicting house prices with:
* **$x_1$ (size):** e.g., 300 - 2000 sq ft (large range)
* **$x_2$ (bedrooms):** e.g., 0 - 5 bedrooms (small range)

* **Impact on Parameters:**
    * For features with a **large range ($x_1$)**, the corresponding parameter ($w_1$) in a good model tends to be **relatively small** (e.g., $w_1=0.1$). A small change in $w_1$ has a large impact on the prediction.
    * For features with a **small range ($x_2$)**, the corresponding parameter ($w_2$) tends to be **relatively large** (e.g., $w_2=50$). A large change in $w_2$ is needed to significantly impact the prediction.

## Impact on Cost Function Contours

When features have disparate scales, the **cost function's contour plot becomes elongated and "tall and skinny"** (like a narrow, stretched oval).

* This happens because small changes in $w_1$ (associated with large $x_1$) cause significant changes in cost, creating steep gradients in one direction.
* Conversely, larger changes in $w_2$ (associated with small $x_2$) are needed to have a similar effect on cost, making gradients less steep in that dimension.

<img src="/metadata/tall_and_skinny.png" width="700" />

## Gradient Descent Without Feature Scaling

* On such elongated contours, gradient descent takes an inefficient path.
* It tends to **"bounce back and forth"** across the narrow valleys, making slow progress towards the minimum.

## The Solution: Feature Scaling

<img src="/metadata/tall_and_skinny_2.png" width="700" />

**Feature scaling transforms your data so that all features take on comparable ranges of values** (e.g., all between 0 and 1, or -1 and 1).

* **Effect:** This makes the cost function contours more **circular** (less elongated).
* **Benefit:** Gradient descent can then take a **much more direct path to the global minimum**, significantly **speeding up convergence**.

# Feature Scaling Techniques

Feature scaling standardizes feature ranges, making gradient descent converge faster.

## Scaling to 0-1 Range (Rescaling)

To scale feature $x_j$ (e.g., $x_1$ size: 300-2000 sq ft, $x_2$ bedrooms: 0-5):
* For each $x_j$ value, divide by its maximum value in the training set.
* Example: $x_1 \rightarrow x_1 / 2000$; $x_2 \rightarrow x_2 / 5$.
* Result: $x_1$ now ranges 0.15-1; $x_2$ ranges 0-1.

## Mean Normalization

Rescales features to be centered around zero.
* For each $x_j$: $(x_j - \mu_j) / (\text{max}_j - \text{min}_j)$
    * $\mu_j$ is the mean of feature $j$.
    * $\text{max}_j$ and $\text{min}_j$ are the max and min values of feature $j$.
* Example: $x_1$ (mean 600) $\rightarrow (x_1 - 600) / (2000 - 300)$.
* Result: Features typically range between approximately -1 and +1.

## Z-score Normalization

Rescales features to have zero mean and unit variance (**new feature set now have mean = 0 and std deviation = 1**)
* For each $x_j$: $(x_j - \mu_j) / \sigma_j$
    * $\mu_j$ is the mean of feature $j$.
    * $\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of feature $j$.
* Example: $x_1$ (mean 600, std dev 450) $\rightarrow (x_1 - 600) / 450$.
* Result: Features are typically in a range like -3 to +3.

## Rule of Thumb for Feature Ranges

Aim for features to be within the range of **approximately -1 to +1**.
* Ranges like [-3, 3] or [-0.3, 0.3] are usually fine.
* **Rescale if:**
    * Range is very large (e.g., [-100, 100]).
    * Range is very small (e.g., [-0.001, 0.001]).
    * Values are large but within a narrow range (e.g., [98.6, 105]).
* **When in doubt, perform feature scaling.** It almost never hurts and often speeds up gradient descent.

# Monitoring Gradient Descent Convergence

When running gradient descent, it's crucial to know if it's converging, meaning it's effectively finding parameters (w, b) close to the global minimum of the cost function J. This insight also helps in choosing a good learning rate ($\alpha$).

## The Cost Function Plot (Learning Curve)

<img src="/metadata/learning_curve.png" width="400" />

A standard practice is to plot the cost function J (calculated on the training set) against the **number of iterations** of gradient descent.

* **X-axis:** Number of iterations (each representing a simultaneous update of w and b).
* **Y-axis:** Value of the cost function J.

### Interpreting the Learning Curve:

1.  **Decreasing Cost:** If gradient descent is working correctly, the cost J **must decrease after every single iteration**.
    * If J ever **increases** after an iteration, it typically means $\alpha$ is too large, or there's a bug in the code.
2.  **Convergence:** The curve will eventually **level off** and flatten out. This indicates that gradient descent has largely converged, as the cost is no longer significantly decreasing.
    * The number of iterations needed for convergence varies greatly (e.g., 30 to 100,000 iterations). Plotting helps determine this visually.

## Automatic Convergence Test (Alternative)

An alternative to visual inspection is an **automatic convergence test**.

* Define a small threshold, $\epsilon$ (e.g., 0.001 or $10^{-3}$).
* If the decrease in cost J from one iteration to the next is **less than $\epsilon$**, declare convergence.
* **Caveat:** Choosing an appropriate $\epsilon$ can be difficult. Visual inspection of the learning curve is often preferred as it provides more insights and can flag issues earlier.

Understanding how to interpret this learning curve is vital for diagnosing and improving your gradient descent implementation, especially when choosing the learning rate, which is the topic of the next video.

# Choosing the Learning Rate ($\alpha$) for Gradient Descent

The learning rate ($\alpha$) is critical for gradient descent efficiency. A poorly chosen $\alpha$ can lead to slow convergence or outright failure.

## Diagnosing $\alpha$ Issues from the Cost Plot

* **Cost J increases or oscillates (goes up and down):** This is a strong sign that $\alpha$ is **too large**. Gradient descent is overshooting the minimum.
    * **Solution:** Decrease $\alpha$.
* **Cost J consistently increases:** This also indicates $\alpha$ is too large, but could also mean a **bug in the code** (e.g., using `+` instead of `-` in the update rule).

<img src="/metadata/learning_rate.png" width="500" />

## Debugging Tip:

* If gradient descent is not working, try setting $\alpha$ to a **very small number** (e.g., 0.00001).
* If J still doesn't decrease on every iteration, there's likely a **bug** in your code.
* (Note: A very small $\alpha$ is for debugging, not efficient training.)

## Finding a Good $\alpha$:

There's a trade-off:
* **Too small $\alpha$:** Gradient descent will be very slow.
* **Too large $\alpha$:** Gradient descent may fail to converge.

**Practical approach:**
1.  **Try a range of $\alpha$ values:** Start with a small value (e.g., 0.001) and increase by factors of 3 (e.g., 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, etc.).
2.  **Plot J vs. iterations:** For each $\alpha$, run gradient descent for a few hundred iterations and plot the cost function.
3.  **Select the best $\alpha$:** Choose the largest $\alpha$ that consistently and rapidly decreases the cost without diverging or oscillating. This typically balances speed and convergence.


# Feature Engineering: Creating Effective Features

Choosing the right features is crucial for a learning algorithm's performance in many applications. **Feature engineering** involves using domain knowledge to design new, more effective features, typically by transforming or combining existing ones.

## Example: Predicting House Prices

Consider predicting house prices with two features:
* $x_1$: Lot width
* $x_2$: Lot length

A simple model might use $f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b$.

However, intuition suggests that **land area** ($x_1 \times x_2$) might be a stronger predictor of price than width and depth separately.

* Define a new feature, $x_3 = x_1 \times x_2$ (area).
* Then, update the model to include this new feature: $f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + b$.

This allows the model to learn the importance of frontage, depth, or the newly engineered area feature in predicting price. Feature engineering makes it easier for the learning algorithm to make accurate predictions.

# Polynomial Regression: Fitting Curves to Data

So far, we've focused on fitting straight lines. Now, let's explore **polynomial regression**, a powerful technique that uses **feature engineering** to fit non-linear curves to your data.

## Creating Polynomial Features

If a straight line doesn't fit your data well (e.g., house prices vs. size), you can create new features by raising the original feature to various powers.

* **Example: Quadratic Function**
    * Original feature: $x$ (house size)
    * New features: $x_1 = \text{size}$, $x_2 = \text{size}^2$
    * Model: $f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b$
    * *Consideration:* A quadratic function might eventually predict decreasing prices for larger houses, which might not be realistic.

* **Example: Cubic Function**
    * New features: $x_1 = \text{size}$, $x_2 = \text{size}^2$, $x_3 = \text{size}^3$
    * Model: $f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + b$
    * This can produce curves that capture increasing prices for larger sizes more realistically.

## Importance of Feature Scaling

When creating polynomial features (like $x^2$ or $x^3$), the new features will have **vastly different ranges** compared to the original feature.

* If $x$ ranges from 1 to 1,000:
    * $x^2$ ranges from 1 to 1,000,000.
    * $x^3$ ranges from 1 to 1,000,000,000.
* **Crucial:** Apply **feature scaling** (e.g., mean normalization or Z-score normalization) to these new features before running gradient descent. This ensures all features are in comparable ranges, allowing gradient descent to converge much faster and more reliably.

## Other Feature Choices

You have flexibility in choosing features. For instance, using the square root of $x$ (e.g., $w_1x + w_2\sqrt{x} + b$) can also create a non-linear curve that might fit data well without undesirable dips.

## Deciding on Features

Later in this specialization, you'll learn systematic processes to evaluate different feature choices and models, helping you decide which features to include for the best performance. For now, understand that **feature engineering and polynomial functions expand the types of relationships linear regression can model beyond just straight lines**.
